# dumb
## info
this is a dumb test i made when DimiDimit sent me statuslib on discord. it's uncanny how easy it is
## prerequisites
* ubuntu (other distros might work as well i only tested on ubuntu)
* git
* wget
* a pair of functioning speakers
* alsa-utils (i was gonna make some convoluted way to install it in the script but that didnt work so yeah)
## how to run
1. clone the repo (git clone https://github.com/dj-no/dumb)
2. clone the submodules (git submodule init; git submodule update)
3. mark the .sh script as executable (chmod u=rwx,og=rwx dumb.sh)
4. run it
