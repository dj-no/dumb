# dumb
## info
this is a dumb test i made when DimiDimit sent me statuslib on discord. it's uncanny how easy it is
## prerequisites
* a posix-compatible environment (e.g. linux, cygwin)
* bash
* git
* wget
* a pair of functioning speakers
* an alsa setup (configured by default on most distros)
* alsa-utils (i was gonna make some convoluted way to install it in the script but that didnt work so yeah)
## how to run
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dj-no/dumb
cd dumb
./dumb.sh
```
